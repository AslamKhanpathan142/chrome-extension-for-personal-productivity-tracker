## 📄 TASK DESCRIPTION

The Productivity Tracker Chrome Extension is one of the key tasks in my internship at CODTECH IT Solutions. This project focused on developing a real-time Chrome browser extension using React.js and Browser APIs to help users track and enhance their productivity during browsing sessions.

The extension allows users to set daily goals, monitor their time spent on specific websites, and visualize productivity trends. It is built using Manifest V3, making it compatible with modern Chrome requirements. The frontend is crafted using React.js, and data is managed using the chrome.storage API for persistent local storage.

- Users can:

- Set a daily focus goal

- View a timer tracking time spent on active tabs

- Get real-time popups/alerts when productivity goals are exceeded

- See a dashboard with bar charts displaying website usage trends

I implemented modular components, used React Hooks (useEffect, useState) for real-time updates, and styled the UI with a clean and modern look. The extension runs in the background and listens to browser activity using chrome.tabs and chrome.runtime APIs.
